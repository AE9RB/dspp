# dspp - DSP for C++ [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AE9RB/dspp.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AE9RB/dspp)


The dspp library is a collection of algorithms which are
the building blocks for software defined radios.

 * Modern C++11 using header-only templates.
 * No external libraries are necessary.
 * Integrated benchmarking and testing framework.
 * All algorithms work with float, and double types.
